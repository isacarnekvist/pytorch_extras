# PyTorch Extras
This repository includes additional implementations that are helpful in machine/reinforcement learning. Will add more things as I go.

## ml.py
Online input and output normalization. Useful when statistics are not known a priori.

## rl.py
So far, a replay buffer inheriting from the Dataset class, such that in can be used within the DataLoader.

# Installation
The requirements are given without version yet
